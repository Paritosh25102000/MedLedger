Blockchain-based EHR

## Problem Statement:
Data sharing, privacy, and interoperability issues have up until now been the biggest challenges in population health management. Blockchain technology is known for these very features. When used properly, this technology improves security, data interchange, interoperability, integrity, real-time updating, and access. Significant worries exist over data security as well, particularly in the areas of wearable technology and individualised treatment. Blockchain technology is used to address these problems since patients and medical staff need simple, safe ways to capture, send, and consult data via networks without security worries.

Given the major inadequacies of the current state of EHRs(privacy, security concerns, inaccurate information and malpractice issues), I plan to improve its shortcomings and develop a robust platform to store healthcare data. There are hardly a few existing Blockchain based EHRs and their usage in the industry is very limited.

Reiterating our previous point, it is critical to strike when the iron is hot. I believe entering the underrated space of Blockchain based EHRs right now would be the best way of expressing our belief in its bright future. As an end product of this project, we will have a complete working prototype with a functional front-end and back-end.

# What is blockchain
Blockchain is a way of storing digital data. The data can literally be anything. For Bitcoin, it's the transactions (logs of transfers of Bitcoin from one account to another account), but it can even be files; it doesn't matter. The data is stored in the form of blocks, which are linked (or chained) together by cryptographic hashes. Hence the name "blockchain."

All of the magic lies in the way this data is stored and added to the blockchain. A blockchain is essentially a linked-list containing ordered-data, with some
constraints like below:
·         Blocks can't be modified once added; in other words, it is "append-only."
·         There are specific rules for appending data to it.
·         It's distributed in architecture.

Enforcing these constraints yields some highly desirable characteristics:
·         Immutability and durability of data
·         No single point of control or failure
·         A verifiable audit trail of the order in which data was added

# Advantages:
